**The Human Cost**
*   "619 lives lost from heat exposure."

*   "In Whitehorse the number of days over 30° C are projected to increase from one day every decade, to two days every year by mid-century—a 20-fold increase."
*   "Without action on adaptation there could be an average of **1,370 heat-related deaths per year by 2030**."
*   "In a high-warming scenario, costs due to heat-related hospitalizations will rise to over **$250 million per year** toward the end of the century."

*   "Main fleet of helicopters... has a stated maximum operating temperature of 45° C... suggesting that air ambulances may not be able to perform all of their necessary functions."
*   "By mid-century, we estimate that there would be at least two weeks each summer that some helicopters would be grounded."
*   "Wear and tear on B.C.’s roads... cost the provincial and municipal governments an estimated additional **$175 million per year by 2030**."

**Agriculture & Food Systems**
*   "661,000 poultry died... represents more than $5 million in revenue losses."
