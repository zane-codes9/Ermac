1. Heatwaves and Emergency Departments in Italy

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (ENGLISH)
Due to global warming and climate change, periods of unusual heat called heatwaves are increasing
in frequency and intensity. Heatwaves pose an important risk for population health and are associated
with an increased demand for emergency care. This overload on prehospital emergency medicine
(PHEM) and emergency departments (EDs) during heatwaves has been retrospectively confirmed,
but evidence on how to mitigate this effect still needs to be provided. This PhD project aimed at
finding the factors causing PHEM and ED overload during heatwaves using qualitative methods.
First, an online Delphi study included 15 experts in emergency medicine, disaster medicine, or public
health. Thirty-one statements were obtained after content analysis. The experts agreed on 18 state-
ments, mostly focusing on the input section of patient processing and identifying stakeholders, the
population, and primary care as targets of potential interventions. Additional dedicated resources and
bed capacity were deemed important as per throughput and output sections, respectively. Since the
results of the Delphi study mainly dealt with the ED, a multicentric study using semi-structured in-
terviews was performed to shed light on PHEM systems. Thirteen PHEM doctors and nurses working
in Veneto region, Northern Italy, were interviewed. After content analysis, their perspectives
were categorized into four themes: perception of heatwaves; clinical impact of heatwaves; social fac-
tors and heatwaves; heatwaves and emergency medical service (EMS). According to the interview-
ees, the strain on EMS during heatwaves may be partially reduced by interventions targeting vulner-
able populations, primary care, social networks, and education and information. Specific actions
could follow the surge science principles of staff, stuff, structure, and system to help policymakers
improve EMS surge capacity planning, preparedness, and response against heatwaves.
Overall, these findings could be used in the future to implement heat-health action plans and test
solutions to increase emergency healthcare resilience during heatwaves, reduce dysfunction due to
overload, and mitigate disaster risk due to climatic change.

This document is a **Doctoral Thesis** titled **"Heatwaves and Emergency Departments in Italy (HEAT-ED IT): Strategies to identify determinants of overload and mitigate impact"** authored by **Matteo Paganini**. It was submitted in **November 2024** to the **Università del Piemonte Orientale (UPO)** and **Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)** as part of the "International Doctoral Program in Global Health, Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Medicine."

The following is a verbatim overview of the document’s contents, findings, and structure.

### **Problem Statement and Context**
*   **Global Warming:** The introduction asserts that "Global warming is a demonstrated phenomenon resulting in atmospheric and oceanic average temperatures rise" and describes it as "the biggest global health threat of the 21st century."
*   **Extreme Weather Events (EWEs):** The thesis notes that "EWEs accounts for 90% of all the disasters in the last 20 years and, more importantly, their frequency has increased by 46% from 2007 to 2016."
*   **Impact on Healthcare:** "Heatwaves impact all health systems’ components by worsening population morbidity, interfering with essential infrastructure, or introducing collateral incidents." Specifically, "heat event days occurring each summer in USA are estimated to result in about 234,000 ED visits."
*   **Research Gap:** A scoping review conducted by the author found that "none of the retrieved full-texts analyzed or at least summarized the factors predisposing to emergency medical care overload during heatwaves."

### **Methodology**
The project employed two primary qualitative research techniques:
1.  **Delphi Study (Chapter 3):** An "expert opinion study" aimed at identifying factors causing emergency care overload.
    *   **Participants:** "15 experts... from Australia (n=4), Belgium (n=3), and Italy (n=2)" with expertise in "emergency medicine; disaster medicine; or public health."
    *   **Process:** Three rounds of surveys to reach consensus on statements regarding overload factors.
2.  **Semi-Structured Interviews (Chapter 4):** A multicentric qualitative study involving Prehospital Emergency Medicine (PHEM) personnel.
    *   **Setting:** The **Veneto Region** in Northeastern Italy.
    *   **Participants:** "13 (7 nurses and 7 doctors [sic]... final number of included to 13)" recruited from the Regional EMS network.
    *   **Objective:** To identify "vulnerability factors predisposing EMS to overload or dysfunction during heatwaves."

### **Key Findings**

**From the Delphi Study (18 Consensus Statements):**
The experts agreed on statements categorized by the **Input-Throughput-Output** model:
*   **Input:** "Availability of air conditioning at home or access to cooled spaces can reduce heat-related illnesses" (Mean score: 6.3/7). "Information campaigns about Heatwaves can help increase community awareness" (Mean score: 6.2/7).
*   **Throughput:** "Emergency planning and surge capacity development are important to prevent emergency medical care overload" (Mean score: 6.0/7). "Training of healthcare personnel... could improve heat-related illness diagnosis and treatment."
*   **Output:** "The reduction of hospital bed capacity during summer can worsen emergency medical care overload during heatwaves."

**From the Qualitative Interviews (PHEM Perspective):**
Interviewees identified four main themes:
1.  **Perception of Heatwaves:** Defined primarily by "High temperatures" and "Humidity."
2.  **Clinical Impact:** Concerns focused on "vulnerable/frail groups" (children, elderly, homeless). Conditions included "Acute on chronic illness," "Syncope," and behavioral changes like "More aggressive behaviors."
3.  **Social Factors:** "Lack of behavioral adaptations," "Air conditioning not installed or not working due to economic concerns," and "Lack or failure of family support."
4.  **Heatwaves and EMS:**
    *   **Staff:** Concerns for safety ("under the sun"), fatigue, and "Need for more personnel."
    *   **Stuff:** "Need for more equipment" including ice, fluids, and vehicle climatization.
    *   **System:** "Inadequate availability of general practitioners" and a need for "Strengthening primary care."

### **Recommendations (Chapter 5)**
The thesis synthesizes findings into specific recommendations for policymakers and healthcare systems, structured by the patient flow framework:

*   **Input:**
    *   "Tailored awareness campaigns."
    *   "Develop telemedicine dedicated to the frail strata of the population (e.g., a telephone helpline for counseling)."
    *   "Local authorities should consider postponing events coinciding with heatwaves."
    *   Provide "economic incentives for air conditioning and against poor housing."

*   **Throughput:**
    *   "Integrate heat-health services into HHAPs [Heat-Health Action Plans]."
    *   "Expand training, increase resources, and ensure staff support."
    *   "Establish temporary triage centers and pre-designated cooling zones for critical cases."

*   **Output:**
    *   "Enhance hospital surge capacity and expedite discharge processes during heatwaves."
    *   "Adapt hospital bed capacity when HHAPs are activated."

### **Conclusion**
The thesis concludes that while "emergency medical care suffers from an overload of patients... studies testing solutions... are lacking." The author states that "stakeholders and policymakers should improve HHAPs with actions raising the awareness of the population, supporting frailer strata with social interventions, and strengthening primary care." The findings are intended to "produce high-quality evidence and achieve the overarching aim of reducing the burden of climate change."

2-Factors causing emergency medical care
overload during heatwaves: A Delphi study

Abstract
Heatwaves pose an important risk for population health and are associated with an increased
demand for emergency care. To find factors causing such overload, an online Delphi study
included 15 experts in emergency medicine, disaster medicine, or public health. One open-
ended question was delivered in the first round. After content analysis, the obtained state-
ments were sent to the experts in two rounds to be rated on a 7-point linear scale. Consensus
was defined as a standard deviation �1.0. Thirty-one statements were obtained after content
analysis. The experts agreed on 18 statements, mostly focusing on the input section of
patient processing and identifying stakeholders, the population, and primary care as targets
of potential interventions. Additional dedicated resources and bed capacity were deemed
important as per throughput and output sections, respectively. These findings could be used
in the future to implement and test solutions to increase emergency healthcare resilience dur-
ing heatwaves and reduce disaster risk due to climatic change.

Climate change represents one of the most complex chal-
lenges faced by humankind in recent history [1]. Due to
its features – mainly the gradual onset and the wide range
of effects across different regions – the awareness of pop-
ulations and governments is low. Consequently, strate-
gies to contain the rise in global average temperature are
difficult to put into practice [2]. The most evident mani-
festations of climate change are extreme weather events
– such as droughts, floods, or periods of extreme temper-
atures – whose trend in frequency and intensity is pro-
gressively increasing [3]. Although the mitigation of the
impacts of such hazards should be among the priorities of
governments, strategies to limit global warming and pol-
icies to improve preparedness toward extreme weather
events are scarcely reported in the literature [4].
Among extreme weather events, heatwaves represent
one of the most common extreme temperature events;
however, no universally accepted definition has been
currently established. These complex phenomena are
complicated to study and compare with each other, due
to differences in features and locations. Nevertheless,
current literature suggests a relationship between heat-
waves and mortality, morbidity, or the burden posed on
healthcare systems and their components. However, the
lack of high-quality evidence hampers the development
of evidence-based mitigation strategies [4].
In the specific case of emergency medical care, increased
presentations and usage rates have been consistently
described during heatwaves in emergency departments
(EDs) and emergency medical services (EMSs). Several
retrospective analyses confirmed an overall increase in ED
accesses during heatwaves in different countries, ranging
from 2% [5,6] to 19% [7] for all-cause presentations. Calkins
et al. [8] also identified an 8 and 14% rise in EMS dispatch
during heatwaves for basic life support and advanced life
support ambulances, respectively. These results are con-
sistent with other studies that reported an overall increase
in ambulance dispatch of 4% [5] and 14% [6].
However, it is still unclear if these heatwave-related
increases in ED presentations and EMS usage rates could
affect ED system performances and result in hospital care
dysfunction. Toloo et al. [9] detected an increased input
due to heat-related illness in 11 EDs from the greater
Brisbane area (Australia) during the period 2000–2012;
among the secondary outcomes, a longer stay in the ED
for these patients was detected. Higher in-ED [10] and
inhospital [7] mortality rates have also been measured
during heatwaves. Even though the specific association
with ED overload was not investigated, it is reasonable to
think that higher volumes of patients, along with emer-
gency medical care and hospital systems’ maladaptation
leading to bottlenecks in patient processing, might have
contributed to these negatively measured outcomes.
Knowing the magnitude of emergency medical care over-
load due to heatwaves, a step toward better care should be
achieved by investigating and then implementing inter-
ventions targeting its specific predisposing factors. The
authors performed a scoping review to include any study
dealing with emergency medical care (EDs and EMSs)
and heatwaves and identify these vulnerability factors,
but none of the records analyzed the possible causes of
emergency medical care overload during heatwaves. In
our opinion, this relevant gap in the literature is the epi-
phenomenon of a not-in-depth studied field.
Since the workflow in emergency medicine is not exclu-
sively focused on a single patient, but also considers groups
of patients, processes, and systems at the same time with
a peculiar public health perspective [11], the constant
monitoring of operational efficiency of the whole system
– prehospital and inhospital – is crucial. The above-de-
scribed heatwave-related overload of emergency medical
care presents several overlapping features with a phe-
nomenon called ‘ED overcrowding’, a global health issue
leading to a considerable worsening in patient outcomes
and clinical risk [12]. As such, methods commonly used
to evaluate the factors predisposing to ED overcrowding
could be used to identify factors causing heatwave-re-
lated overload. Kelen et al. [12] recently conducted a root
cause analysis of ED overcrowding, highlighting that
the traditional input-throughput-output model used for

patient processing analysis can be helpful but not exhaus-
tive and, therefore, addressed healthcare systems’ eco-
nomic aspects previously neglected. The authors present
a granular analysis of prehospital-, ED-, and hospital-re-
lated factors causing ED overcrowding and recommend
several possible solutions based on public health and dis-
aster medicine principles [13]. In the same vein, during a
heatwave, processes aiming to improve factors internal to
EDs and EMSs but also targeting primary and inhospital
care could reduce the overload for emergency medical
care. For example, a tailored information service availa-
ble to the vulnerable populations, early warning systems
triggering the recruitment of extra personnel, or a spe-
cifically activated hospital-based unit reducing boarding
dysfunction could constitute effective interventions that
can mitigate the impact of heatwaves on EDs. Surveys
can be another valuable tool to investigate the factors
underlying ED overcrowding [14]. For example, Bond et
al. tried to increase knowledge about factors determining
ED overcrowding by interviewing a sample of Canadian
ED directors. Space constraints, boarding delays, and
the increasing complexity of cases were identified as
the leading causes of ED overcrowding [15]. By repro-
ducing similar studies, researchers could find the targets
of future interventions to mitigate emergency medical
care overload during heatwaves. Also, the lessons learned
during the COVID-19 pandemic could be investigated
in light of heatwave-related surges. As EDs and EMSs
implemented strategies to dynamically repurpose patient
processing protocols, adapt spaces, relocate resources,
and deploy personnel based on COVID-19 contagion
curves, early warning systems and syndromic surveillance
could guide changes in assets allocation before, during,
and after heatwaves [16].
In conclusion, the lack of scientific literature addressing
the factors predisposing emergency medical care to over-
load during heatwaves currently hampers any effective
planning strategy. Therefore, the authors encourage the
empowerment of research in this field. Taking inspira-
tion from the existing ED overcrowding literature and
consulting the opinions of relevant experts in this field,
scholars will then be able to design and implement effec-
tive interventions to mitigate emergency medical care
overload during heatwaves

Abstract: Heatwaves are periods of unusual heat, whose frequency and intensity is increasing. Heat-
waves also translate into emergency healthcare dysfunctions, but evidence on how to mitigate these
effects still needs to be provided. This multicentric study aimed to identify the interactions between
heatwaves and prehospital emergency medicine (PHEM). After obtaining informed consent, PHEM
personnel working full-time in different districts of the Veneto Region, Northern Italy, were recruited.
Their perspective was captured through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using content
analysis methodology. Thirteen subjects participated in the study. Their insights were categorized
into four themes: perception of heatwaves; clinical impact of heatwaves; social factors and heatwaves;
heatwaves and emergency medical service (EMS). According to the interviewees, the strain on EMSs
during heatwaves may be partially reduced by interventions targeting vulnerable populations, pri-
mary care, social networks, and education and information. Specific public health actions could
follow the surge science principles of staff, stuff, structure, and system to help policymakers improve
EMS surge capacity planning, preparedness, and responses. The present study also identified PHEM
vulnerabilities and targets of interventions to implement heat–health action plans, mitigate the risk of
prehospital emergency care dysfunction, and improve EMS sustainability and preparedness against
heatwaves and the changing climate.

Abstract
Objectives: Extreme heat events (EHEs) are associated with excess healthcare utiliza-
tion but specific impacts on emergency department (ED) operations and throughput
are unknown. In 2021, the Pacific Northwest experienced an unprecedented heat
dome that resulted in substantial regional morbidity and mortality. The aim of this
study was to examine its impact on ED utilization, unplanned hospitalization, and
hospital operations in a large academic healthcare system.
Methods: Retrospective electronic medical records from three Seattle-area hospitals
were used to compare healthcare utilization during the EHE compared to a pre-event
reference period within the same month. Interrupted time series analysis was used
to evaluate the association between EHE exposure and ED visits and hospitalizations.
Metrics of ED crowding for the EHE were compared to the reference period using Stu-
dent’s t-tests and chi-squared tests. Additionally, multivariable Poisson regression was
used to identify risk factors for heat-related illness and hospital admission.
Results: Interrupted time series analysis showed an increase of 21.7 ED visits per day
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.7, 28.6) and 9.9 unplanned hospitalizations per day
(95% CI = 8.3, 11.5) during the EHE, as compared to the reference period. ED crowding
and process measures also displayed significant increases, becoming the most pro-
nounced by day 3 of the EHE; the EHE was associated with delays in ED length of stay
of 1.0 h (95% CI = 0.4, 1.6) compared to the reference period. Higher incidence rate
ratios for heat-related illness were observed for patients who were older (incidence
rate ratio [IRR] = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01,1.03), female (IRR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.06, 2.04),
or who had pre-existing diabetes (IRR = 3.19; 95% CI = 1.47, 6.94).
Conclusions: The 2021 heat dome was associated with a significant increase in health-
care utilization including ED visits and unplanned hospitalizations. Substantial impacts
on ED and hospital throughput were also noted. These findings contribute to the

6-Killer Alerts? Public Health Warnings and
Heat Stroke in Japan

ABSTRACT
IZA DP No. 16562 OCTOBER 2023Killer Alerts? Public Health Warnings and
Heat Stroke in Japan*
In 2020, Japan introduced a comprehensive heat-health warning system where daily alerts
were issued by region when forecasted wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) exceeded
a threshold (33 °C). Utilizing plausibly exogenous region-day variation in the difference
between actual and forecasted WBGT (i.e. forecasting errors), we find that the alerts led
to a large and precisely estimated increase in heat stroke counts. Paired with data from
Google Trends, Google Mobility Reports, and the population of ambulance records, we
identify potential mechanisms, including increased reporting of heat stroke cases and
“adverse” behavioral responses (e.g. people spending more time outdoors) when alerts
were issued, while ruling out potential substitution in health diagnoses away from other
sudden illnesses.

**Document Type:** Discussion Paper (IZA DP No. 16562)
**Title:** "Killer Alerts? Public Health Warnings and Heat Stroke in Japan"
**Authors:** Lester Lusher (University of Pittsburgh and IZA) and Tim Ruberg (University of Hohenheim)
**Date:** October 2023

**Core Study & Context**
The paper investigates the "causal impacts" of a "comprehensive heat-health warning system" introduced in Japan in 2020.
*   **The Policy:** Daily alerts were issued by region when "forecasted wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) exceeded a threshold (33°C)." Alerts are communicated via the "Ministry of Environment’s homepage, weather news broadcasting stations, radio, public institutions, social networking services... and smartphone applications."
*   **The Objective:** The alerts encourage citizens to "stay at home, drink a lot, take salt, avoid exercise, use air-conditioning, and report to others if they are in poor physical condition."

**Data Sources**
*   **Heat Stroke Data:** Administrative data from the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA) on "the number of heat strokes by age group, place of incidence, and severity, for each of 47 prefectures on a daily basis" from 2017 to 2022.
*   **Weather Data:** "Forecasted and actual WBGT" data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) across 1,300 weather stations.
*   **Behavioral Data:** "Google Trends and Google Community Mobility Reports, which tracked daily foot traffic across locations."
*   **Ambulance Records:** Micro-data from the "population of ambulance records in Japan."

**Empirical Strategy**
The authors utilize "plausibly exogenous region-day variation in the difference between actual and forecasted WBGT (i.e. forecasting errors)."
*   The model compares "region-days where an alert was issued but the actual WBGT was below 33.0°C (i.e. a false positive) and region-dates where an alert was not issued but the actual WBGT exceeded 33.0°C (i.e. a false negative)."
*   The primary sample consists of "20,612 observations," restricted to days with a WBGT of at least 28°C.

**Key Findings**
The study finds that the alerts led to a "large and precisely estimated increase in heat stroke counts."
*   **Increase in Cases:** "A heat-health warning increases the incidence of heat stroke hospitalizations by nearly 17%."
*   **Severity:** Effects exist across the spectrum, including "severe cases which require multiple weeks of hospitalization."
*   **Demographics:** "The largest increase in heat stroke incidence is experienced by adults and the elderly in particular."
*   **Mortality:** The authors "estimate a small but statistically insignificant increase in overall mortality."

**Mechanisms and Behavioral Responses**
The paper identifies potential mechanisms for the "seemingly counter-intuitive results" using Google data and ambulance records:

*   **Increased Reporting:** The alerts may have "raised general awareness," leading to an "increased reporting" effect where people report "what were otherwise unidentified cases of heat stroke."
*   **Adverse Behavior (Leaving Home):**
    *   Google Mobility Reports show that "people were *more* likely to leave their home on alert days."
    *   This behavior "stands in direct contrast to the government guideline to stay home and use air conditioner."
    *   There was a "large increase in visitations to parks" and increased Google searches for "outdoor activities such as 'sea bathing' and 'park'."
*   **No Substitution Effect:** Analysis of ambulance data for other sudden illnesses (e.g., traffic accidents, natural disasters) shows "statistically insignificant effects," ruling out the possibility that heat stroke diagnoses were simply being "substituted" from other illnesses.
*   **Energy Consumption:** The study finds a "weak overall increase in energy consumption of 3%" on alert days, likely due to air conditioning, but posits that households might also be "saving energy on (what households perceive to be) especially hot days" due to price sensitivity.

**Conclusion**
*   "We document substantial variation, with no manipulation, in whether an alert was issued for a region-day."
*   "Our findings suggest an increase in hospitalizations for heat stroke in response to a heat alert being issued."
*   "We do not find any clear evidence for avoidance behavior except for an increase in the search term 'air conditioner'."
*   Instead of staying indoors, "people were *more* likely to leave their home residence on heat alert days in favor of visiting both indoor and outdoor locations (i.e. parks)."

7-Climate Change and Emergency Medicine

Climate Change and Emergency Medicine:
Impacts and Opportunities
Jeremy J. Hess, MD, MPH, Katherine L. Heilpern, MD, Timothy E. Davis, MD, MPH, and
Howard Frumkin, MD, DrPH
Abstract
There is scientific consensus that the climate is changing, that human activity plays a major role, and
that the changes will continue through this century. Expert consensus holds that significant health
effects are very likely. Public health and health care systems must understand these impacts to properly
pursue preparedness and prevention activities. All of medicine will very likely be affected, and certain
medical specialties are likely to be more significantly burdened based on their clinical activity, ease of
public access, public health roles, and energy use profiles. These specialties have been called on to con-
sider the likely impacts on their patients and practice and to prepare their practitioners. Emergency
medicine (EM), with its focus on urgent and emergent ambulatory care, role as a safety-net provider,
urban concentration, and broad-based clinical mission, will very likely experience a significant rise in
demand for its services over and above current annual increases. Clinically, EM will see amplification of
weather-related disease patterns and shifts in disease distribution. In EM’s prehospital care and disaster
response activities, both emergency medical services (EMS) activity and disaster medical assistance team
(DMAT) deployment activities will likely increase. EM’s public health roles, including disaster prepared-
ness, emergency department (ED)-based surveillance, and safety-net care, are likely to face increasing
demands, along with pressures to improve fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally,
EM’s roles in ED and hospital management, particularly related to building and purchasing, are likely to
be impacted by efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy efficiency. Climate
change thus presents multiple clinical and public health challenges to EM, but also creates numerous
opportunities for research, education, and leadership on an emerging health issue of global scope.

8-Exploration with Process Mining on How Temperature Change Affects Hospital Emergency Departments

Abstract

The way patients are treated in Hospital Emergency Departments changes during the year, depending on many factors. One key component is weather temperature. Some seasonal maladies are tightly related to temperature, such as flu in cold weather or sunburn in hot weather. In this study, data from a hospital in Valencia was used to explore how harsh weather changes affect the emergency department, obtaining information about probable impacts of global warming effects in healthcare systems. Process mining techniques helped in the discovery of changes in the Emergency Departments. Some illnesses, such as heat stroke, are more prevalent during heatwaves, but more interestingly, the time to attend patients is also higher.

CLIMATE ADAPTATION IN OUT-OF-HOSPITAL SETTINGS 3
Abstract
The study contributes insights to the academic dialogue surrounding the resilience and
practices of ambulance services, particularly in the context of escalating climate-related risks
and overlapping disasters, such as pandemics. This study uses a pragmatic lens to highlight
the implications for operational adjustments within the British Columbia Emergency Health
Services (BCEHS) and comparable organizations. This research focus is a single BCEHS
case study on the ambulance system’s resilience in the face of climate change-related
disasters. The research focuses on operational capacity and organizational resilience in the
context of climate disasters, such as wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and other health
emergencies, such as pandemics. Key findings indicate challenges in organizational
resilience, with staffing shortages emerging as the most-cited risk identified by 88.3% of
respondents, highlighting vulnerabilities. The study applies the principles of high reliability
organizations (HRO) and a complexity lens (i.e., wicked problems) and uses a mixed-
methods approach involving interviews, a focus group, and a Likert-scale survey. The data
were captured from disasters such as COVID-19, the 2021 British Columbia “heat dome”
heatwave, and atmospheric river flooding in British Columbia in fall 2021 to explore and
offer suggestions to improve situational awareness, disaster planning, and training and
exercises, as well as developing strategies to include climate-related disaster risk in
organizational planning and risk assessments.

The adverse influences of climate change are manifesting as health burdens relevant to clinical practice, affecting the very
underpinnings of health and stressing the health care system. Emergency medicine is likely to bear a large burden, with its focus on
urgent and emergency care, through its role as a safety-net provider for vulnerable populations and as a leader in disaster medicine.
Clinically, climate change is affecting emergency medicine practice through the amplification of climate-related disease patterns and
epidemiologic shifts for conditions diagnosed and treated in emergency departments (EDs), especially for vulnerable populations. In
addition, climate-driven intensification of extreme weather is disrupting health care delivery in EDs and health care systems. Thus,
there are significant opportunities for emergency medicine to lead the medical response to climate change through 7 key areas:
clinical practice improvements, building resilient EDs and health care systems, adaptation and public health engagement, disaster
preparedness, mitigation, research, and education. In the face of this growing health threat, systemwide preparation rooted in local
leadership and responsiveness is necessary to efficiently and effectively care for our vulnerable communities. [Ann Emerg Med.
