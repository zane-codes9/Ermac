Ecosystems and biological systems are known to be inherently
complex and to exhibit nonlinear dynamics. Diseases such as
microbiome dysregulation or depression can be seen as
complex systems as well and were shown to exhibit patterns of
nonlinearity in their response to perturbations. These
nonlinearities can be revealed by a sudden shift in system
states, for instance from health to disease. The identification
and characterization of early warning signals which could
predict upcoming critical transitions is of primordial interest as
prevention of disease onset is a major aim in health care. In this
review, we focus on recent evidence for critical transitions in
diseases and discuss the potential of such studies for
therapeutic applications. 

Conclusions
Although a large number of theoretical studies and com-
putational simulations have been carried out to provide
evidence for catastrophic shifts, there are still only a few
biological and medical studies experimentally or empiri-
cally validating the predictions and the relevance of the
critical transition concept for medical applications.
Furthermore, error rate estimations for false positive and
false negative rates of the models underlying the predic-
tions are rarely available. In order to prevent or revert
critical system states this will become more important
[63 ]. In some disciplines, replicate experiments are
often not possible, for example, when analyzing the
occurrence of ice-ages, the sudden collapse of fish-popu-
lations or catastrophic transitions in the financial markets,
as has been witnessed a few years ago. Biological systems
and disease pathogenesis however might be studied in
depth in animal models, patients with identical or closely
related clinical symptoms or adverse responses to specific
drug treatments. Due to this feasibility and their import-
ance, biological and biomedical applications might play a 
driver role in our attempts to experimentally dissect and
understand complex nonlinear natural systems. The de-
velopment of system specific mathematical models and
machine learning tools, integrating a wide range of omics
and clinical data, and prior knowledge, for example, from
literature, public databases and modern media, will
become a central domain in systems medicine.

Abstract
Emerging and re-emerging pathogens exhibit very complex dynamics, are hard to model
and difficult to predict. Their dynamics might appear intractable. However, new statistical
approaches—rooted in dynamical systems and the theory of stochastic processes—have
yielded insight into the dynamics of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. We argue that
these approaches may lead to new methods for predicting epidemics. This perspective
views pathogen emergence and re-emergence as a “critical transition,” and uses the
concept of noisy dynamic bifurcation to understand the relationship between the system
observables and the distance to this transition. Because the system dynamics exhibit char-
acteristic fluctuations in response to perturbations for a system in the vicinity of a critical
point, we propose this information may be harnessed to develop early warning signals. Spe-
cifically, the motion of perturbations slows as the system approaches the transition.

Abstract: Understanding epidemic dynamics has always been a challenge. As witnessed from
the ongoing Zika or the seasonal Influenza epidemics, we still need to improve our analytical
methods to better understand and control epidemics. While the emergence of complex sciences in
the turn of the millennium have resulted in their implementation in modelling epidemics, there
is still a need for improving our understanding of critical dynamics in epidemics. In this study,
using agent-based modelling, we simulate a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic on
a homogeneous network. We use transfer entropy and active information storage from information
dynamics framework to characterise the critical transition in epidemiological models. Our study
shows that both (bias-corrected) transfer entropy and active information storage maximise after
the critical threshold (R0 = 1). This is the first step toward an information dynamics approach to
epidemics. Understanding the dynamics around the criticality in epidemiological models can provide
us insights about emergent diseases and disease control.

Early warning signals (EWSs) are a group of statistical time-series signals
which could be used to anticipate a critical transition before it is reached.
EWSs are model-independent methods that have grown in popularity to sup-
port evidence of disease emergence and disease elimination. Theoretical work
has demonstrated their capability of detecting disease transitions in simple epi-
demic models, where elimination is reached through vaccination, to more
complex vector transmission, age-structured and metapopulation models.
However, the exact time evolution of EWSs depends on the transition; here
we review the literature to provide guidance on what trends to expect and
when. Recent advances include methods which detect when an EWS becomes
significant; the earlier an upcoming disease transition is detected, the more
valuable an EWS will be in practice. We suggest that future work should firstly
validate detection methods with synthetic and historical datasets, before
addressing their performance with real-time data which is accruing. A major
challenge to overcome for the use of EWSs with disease transitions is to main-
tain the accuracy of EWSs in data-poor settings. We demonstrate how EWSs
behave on reported cases for pertussis in the USA, to highlight some limitations
when detecting disease transitions with real-world data.

Vaccine refusal can lead to renewed outbreaks of previously
eliminated diseases and even delay global eradication. Vaccinating
decisions exemplify a complex, coupled system where vaccinating
behavior and disease dynamics influence one another. Such
systems often exhibit critical phenomena—special dynamics close
to a tipping point leading to a new dynamical regime. For instance,
critical slowing down (declining rate of recovery from small per-
turbations) may emerge as a tipping point is approached. Here, we
collected and geocoded tweets about measles–mumps–rubella
vaccine and classified their sentiment using machine-learning al-
gorithms. We also extracted data on measles-related Google
searches. We find critical slowing down in the data at the level
of California and the United States in the years before and after
the 2014–2015 Disneyland, California measles outbreak. Critical
slowing down starts growing appreciably several years before
the Disneyland outbreak as vaccine uptake declines and the pop-
ulation approaches the tipping point. However, due to the adap-
tive nature of coupled behavior–disease systems, the population
responds to the outbreak by moving away from the tipping point,
causing“critical speeding up” whereby resilience to perturbations
increases. A mathematical model of measles transmission and vac-
cine sentiment predicts the same qualitative patterns in the neigh-
borhood of a tipping point to greatly reduced vaccine uptake and
large epidemics. These results support the hypothesis that popu-
lation vaccinating behavior near the disease elimination threshold
is a critical phenomenon. Developing new analytical tools to de-
tect these patterns in digital social data might help us identify
populations at heightened risk of widespread vaccine refusal.

Much has been written on student attrition from healthcare programmes and we know that it is often
multifactorial. However in order to reduce attrition we need to gain a greater understanding of how
multiple factors impact upon and compound one another to prompt a student to decide to leave. The
purpose of this study was to explore healthcare students’ experiences of university and the circum-
stances that initiated their decision to leave their programme. Sixteen students that had recently left
healthcare programmes within the North West of England were interviewed by telephone, using
a narrative prompt to facilitate them to tell their stories. All the students gave detailed narrative accounts
that described their learning experiences, growing dissatisfaction and subsequent attrition. In the
majority dissatisfaction and dif culties around clinical placements acted as a tipping point that
precipitated departure.

Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where slowly chang-
ing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new
and sometimes very different state. As the tipping point is
approached, the dynamics of complex and varied systems sim-
plify down to a limited number of possible “normal forms” that
determine qualitative aspects of the new state that lies beyond
the tipping point, such as whether it will oscillate or be sta-
ble. In several of those forms, indicators like increasing lag-1
autocorrelation and variance provide generic early warning sig-
nals (EWS) of the tipping point by detecting how dynamics slow
down near the transition. But they do not predict the nature
of the new state. Here we develop a deep learning algorithm
that provides EWS in systems it was not explicitly trained on, by
exploiting information about normal forms and scaling behav-
ior of dynamics near tipping points that are common to many
dynamical systems. The algorithm provides EWS in 268 empirical
and model time series from ecology, thermoacoustics, climatology,
and epidemiology with much greater sensitivity and specificity
than generic EWS. It can also predict the normal form that char-
acterizes the oncoming tipping point, thus providing qualitative
information on certain aspects of the new state. Such approaches
can help humans better prepare for, or avoid, undesirable state
transitions. The algorithm also illustrates how a universe of
possible models can be mined to recognize naturally occurring
tipping points.

Abstract
Heterogeneous adoption thresholds exist widely in social contagions, such as behavior spreading, but
were always neglected in previous studies. To this end, we introduce heterogeneous adoption
threshold distribution into a non-Markovian spreading threshold model, in which an individual
adopts a behavior only when the received cumulative pieces of behavioral information from neighbors
exceeds his adoption threshold. In order to understand the effects of heterogeneous adoption
thresholds quantitatively, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed. A two-state spreading
threshold model is taken as an example, in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e.,
activists) while the remaining ones hold a relatively higher adoption threshold (i.e., bigots). We nd a
hierarchical characteristic in adopting behavior, i.e., activists rst adopt the behavior and then
stimulate bigots to adopt the behavior. Interestingly, two types of crossover phenomena in phase
transition occur: for a relatively low adoption threshold of bigots, a change from rst-order to second-
order phase transition can be triggered by increasing the fraction of activists; for a relatively higher
adoption threshold of bigots, a change from hybrid to second-order phase transition can be induced
by varying the fraction of activists, decreasing mean degree or enhancing network heterogeneity. The
theoretical predictions based on the suggested theory agree very well with the simulation results.

9-The 'Big Data' Revolution in healthcare

Based on the document titled "The ‘big data’ revolution in healthcare: Accelerating value and innovation" (January 2013) by McKinsey & Company, here is a detailed overview containing raw evidence, data points, and quotes.

Document Overview

Authors: Peter Groves, Basel Kayyali, David Knott, Steve Van Kuiken
Focus: The report asserts that the US healthcare system has reached a "tipping point" regarding data liquidity, creating an opportunity to use "big data" to address quality variability and escalating costs.

The "Tipping Point" Factors

The document identifies a convergence of forces driving this revolution (Exhibit 1):

Demand: Driven by "escalating costs" ($600 billion above expected benchmark by 2009) and a shift from fee-for-service to reimbursement based on "patient outcomes or total cost control."

Supply: EMR adoption rose from 30% in 2005 to "more than 50 percent for physicians and nearly 75 percent for hospitals" by 2011.

Technology: Advances allow systems to "examine information across all data pools," such as combining claims data with clinical data.

Government: Initiatives like the "Health Data Initiative (HDI)" and the "HITECH Act," which authorized "$40 billion in incentive payments for providers to use EMRs."

Primary Data Pools (Exhibit 2)

The report defines four key data pools fueling the revolution:

Activity (claims) and cost data: "Utilization of care, cost estimates."

Clinical data: "Electronic medical records, medical images."

Pharmaceutical R&D data: "Clinical trials, high-throughput-screening libraries."

Patient behavior and sentiment data: "Retail purchase history, exercise data captured in running shoes."

New Value Pathways

The authors define five "value pathways" to capture economic gains (Exhibit 3):

Right Living: "Informed lifestyle choices that promote well-being."

Evidence: Providence Everett Medical Center's wellness program reduced health costs by 14% and the sick-leave rate by 20%.

Right Care: "Evidence-based care that is proven to deliver needed outcomes."

Evidence: Kaiser Permanente’s HealthConnect system "reduced total office visits by 26.2 percent."

Right Provider: "Match of provider skill set to the complexity of the assignment."

Right Value: "Sustainable approaches that continuously enhance healthcare value."

Evidence: Sanofi used real-world data to prove the efficacy of Lantus insulin to German payor G-BA, securing contracts covering "about 90 percent of the German population."

Right Innovation: "Advance the frontiers of medicine and boost R&D productivity."

Evidence: AstraZeneca partnered with WellPoint’s HealthCore to "guide decisions on where to invest its research and development dollars."

Projected Economic Impact

Total Savings: "We estimated that the pathways could account for $300 billion to $450 billion in reduced healthcare spend, or 12 to 17 percent of the $2.6 trillion baseline in US healthcare costs" (Exhibit 4).

Preventative Actions: Measures like aspirin use or cholesterol screening could "reduce the total cost of their care by over $38 billion."

Innovation Landscape

An analysis of over 200 businesses created since 2010 reveals:

Startups:

Asthmapolis: Uses GPS-enabled inhalers to identify asthma catalysts like pollen or volcanic fog.

Ginger.io: Uses mobile sensors to record movement and calling patterns to detect if a patient "feels physically unwell" or if an "anxiety attack is imminent."

Rise Health: Designed an ACO dashboard for provider data exchange.

Trends: "Innovators are primarily developing applications for consumers and providers" rather than business-to-business sales (Exhibit 5).

Data Sources: "About 50 to 70 percent of all innovations depend at least in part on the capture or integration of customers’ own data."

Imperatives and Challenges

Talent Shortage: "By 2018, we expect that the nation will be short two million workers with the required knowledge and expertise" in data analysis, management, and systems.

Privacy: The mindset must shift from "protect" to "share, with protections."

Risks: "Owners of MRI machines... could end up pursuing and receiving unnecessary MRIs" to amortize fixed costs, potentially destroying value.

Stakeholder Priorities

Payors: Must build "new basic data-analytics engines" and isolate "outliers within the provider network."

Providers: Must ensure "consistent and comprehensive data capture" and participate in "Health Information Exchanges (HIEs)."

Manufacturers: Must refocus on "payors and customer value" and monitor "competitor products for safety, efficacy, and value indicators."

Leadership Principles

For senior leaders getting started:

Improve the core business first: Use data to fix weaknesses before pursuing new growth.

Play to win: Make big data a "personal priority."

Promote transparency: Do so before regulators "do so on their behalf."

Set diverse goals: Implement short, medium, and long-term goals (Exhibit 9).

10-A Tipping Point for Measurement-Based Care
John C. Fortney, Ph.D., Jürgen Unützer, M.D., M.P.H., Glenda Wrenn, M.D., M.S.H.P., Jeffrey M. Pyne, M.D.,
G. Richard Smith, M.D., Michael Schoenbaum, Ph.D., Henry T. Harbin, M.D.
Objective: Measurement-based care involves the system-
atic administration of symptom rating scales and use of the
results to drive clinical decision making at the level of the
individual patient. This literature review examined the the-
oretical and empirical support for measurement-based care.
Methods: Articles were identi ed through search strategies
in PubMed and Google Scholar. Additional citations in the
references of retrieved articles were identi ed, and experts
assembled for a focus group conducted by the Kennedy
Forum were consulted.
Results: Fifty-one relevant articles were reviewed. There are
numerous brief structured symptom rating scales that have
strong psychometric properties. Virtually all randomized con-
trolled trials with frequent and timely feedback of patient-
reported symptoms to the provider during the medication
management and psychotherapy encounters signi cantly im-
proved outcomes. Ineffective approaches included one-time
screening, assessing symptoms infrequently, and feeding back
outcomes to providers outside the context of the clinical en-
counter. In addition to the empirical evidence about ef cacy,
there is mounting evidence from large-scale pragmatic trials
and clinical demonstration projects that measurement-based
care is feasible to implement on a large scale and is highly
acceptable to patients and providers.
Conclusions: In addition to the primary gains of measurement-
based care for individual patients, there are also potential
secondary and tertiary gains to be made when individual
patient data are aggregated. Speci cally, aggregated symp-
tom rating scale data can be used for professional devel-
opment at the provider level and for quality improvement at
the clinic level and to inform payers about the value of
mental health services delivered at the health care system
level.
