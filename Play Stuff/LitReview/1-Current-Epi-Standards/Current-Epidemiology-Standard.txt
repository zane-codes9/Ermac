Abstract
Extreme heat is an escalating public health risk in England, linked to substantial heat-
associated mortality. Reliable, timely estimates are essential to monitor impacts, identify
vulnerable groups, and evaluate the effectiveness of public health responses. However,
existing approaches, such as reliance on heat-specific causes of death or use of statistical
models to estimate heat-attributable mortality, risk underestimation or oversimplify the
burden on health.
This study presents the UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) hybrid surveillance method,
which combines estimates of observed all-cause heat-associated deaths during defined heat
episodes with modelled expectations based on recent temperature–mortality relationship.
Observed estimates provide transparent, episode-specific figures disaggregated by age,
sex, setting, cause, and geography, while modelled outputs help to contextualise whether
real-world impacts align with recent trends.
Applied to summer 2024, the approach identified four heat episodes and an estimated 1,311
heat-associated deaths (95% CI: 929–1,692), concentrated among older adults. Modelled
estimates suggested 1,028 deaths (95% CI: 866–1,155). Although confidence intervals
overlapped, observed mortality was consistently higher than predicted, particularly during
earlier summer episodes, suggesting that factors beyond temperature may have amplified
observed impacts. Later episodes, by contrast, showed closer alignment between observed
and expected figures, indicating potential seasonal adaptation or improved preparedness.
By integrating observed mortality with modelled context, UKHSA’s approach avoids
underestimation, supports evaluation of Heat-Health Alerts, and enables year-on-year
monitoring of progress in reducing risks. This dual-method framework provides a practical,
reproducible tool for national surveillance and strengthens the evidence base for targeted
interventions and climate adaptation planning.

2. Impact of temperature on morbidity: New evidence from China☆

Abstract
This paper investigates the relationship between temperature and hospitalization in China. Using inpatient visit claims of two major public insurance schemes covering 47 cities in 28 provinces for three years, we see a 7.3% increase in hospital admissions on days on which the average temperature is above 27 °C, and a 2% increase in 31-day cumulative hospital admissions relative to a benchmark-temperature day in the subsequent weeks. Such an effect is much larger than evidence from developed economies. Using detailed information on medical bills, we calculate that an additional hot day nationwide is associated with approximately 2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.3 billion US dollars) increase in medical expenses that are related to inpatient services, 1.9 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.29 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the public insurance system, and 0.2 billion yuan (roughly equivalent to 0.01 billion US dollars) of which is borne by the insured.

Highlights

    •
    Mortality effects of extreme heat were mainly explained by high temperature.
    •
    Extreme heat effects were higher for the rural areas than urban areas.
    •
    Extreme heat effects were higher for respiratory mortality, for the elderly and for females.

Abstract
Background
Heat waves have been reported to be associated with increased mortality; however, fewer studies have examined the effect modification by heat wave characteristics, individual characteristics and community characteristics.
Methods
This study investigated the effect of extreme heat on mortality in 2 urban and 2 rural communities in Guangdong Province, China during 2006–2010. The effect of extreme heat was divided into two parts: main effect due to high temperature and added effect due to prolonged heat for several consecutive days. A distributed lag non-linear model was used to calculate the relative risk with consideration of lag days and potential confounding factors. Separate models were further fit by individual characteristics (cause of death, age and gender) and heat wave characteristics (intensity, duration and timing), and potential effect modification of community characteristics was examined using a meta-regression, such as educational levels, percentage of the elderly, Gross Regional Domestic Product (GDP).
Results
The overall main effects (ER = 8.2%, 95% CI: 3.4%, 13.2%) were greater than the added effects (ER = 0.0%, 95% CI: − 3.8%, 4.0%) on the current day. The main effect peaked at lag0–2, and was higher for the two rural areas compared to the two cities, for respiratory compared to cardiovascular mortality, for those ≥ 75 years old and for females. The modifying effects of heat wave characteristics and community characteristics on mortality were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
This study suggests the effects of extreme heat were mainly driven by high temperature, which can be modified by some individual characteristics.

4. Different response of human mortality to extreme temperatures (MoET) between rural and urban areas: A multi-scale study across China

Abstract
Background
The environmental variation in mortality due to extreme temperatures has been well-documented by many studies. Mortality to extreme temperatures (MoET) was recognized to vary geographically, either by countries within a region or by areas within a country. However, so far, little attention has been paid to rural residents, with even lesser attention on the potential rural-urban differences. The aim of our study was to offer a quite comprehensive analysis on the differences in temperature-mortality relationship between rural and urban areas across China.
Method
A distributed lag nonlinear model was built to describe the temperature-mortality relationship, based on the mortality data and meteorological variable of 75 communities in China from 2007 to 2012. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was applied to compare the differences in the temperature-mortality relationship between rural and urban areas at various levels.
Results
Distinct responses regarding MoET between rural and urban areas were observed at different spatial scales. At regional level, more U-shaped curves were observed for temperature-mortality relationships in urban areas, while more J-shaped curves were observed in rural areas. At national scale, we found that the cold effect was stronger in rural areas (RR: rural 1.69 vs. urban 1.51), while heat effect was stronger in urban areas (RR: rural 1.01 vs. urban 1.12). Moreover, the modifying influence of air pollution on temperature-mortality relationship was found to be very limited.
Conclusion
The difference in response of MoET between rural and urban areas was noticeable, cold effect is more significant in China both in rural and urban areas. Additionally, urban areas in southern China and rural areas in northern China suffered more from extreme temperature events. Our findings suggest that differences in rural-urban responses to MoET should be taken seriously when intervention measures for reducing the risks to residents’ health were adopted.

5. Prioritizing-Climate-Change-Health

106 DOI: 10.4324/9781003190516-14
Introduction
Climate change is causing an increase in the severity and frequency of
extreme weather events and disasters. It is leading to two major changes in
weather – an increase in average temperatures and an increase in variability
of weather. This leads to the increased possibilities of severe heat and cold
waves. In the last twenty years, extreme heat events have become more
intense, more frequent and longer-lasting, posing a new global challenge to
the health sector worldwide. Extreme heat can lead to dangerous, even
deadly, health consequences, including heat stress and heatstroke. As urban
populations continue to grow, there is an increasingly urgent need for cities
and their residents to adapt to climate change and its impact.
Fortunately, heat-related illnesses are preventable with effective public
health interventions. In India, the city of Ahmedabad took the lead in imple-
menting a citywide preparedness plan and developing city-specific heat-
health thresholds. The Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar
(IIPHG), in collaboration with other partners, developed and implemented
these threshold- based heat action plans. The experience in Ahmedabad pro-
vides compelling evidence that heat action plans can meaningfully reduce
vulnerability to extreme heat and save lives. This chapter will describe
1. Heat waves and their health impacts from the perspective of public
health.
2. Heat Action Plans as public health interventions to reduce heat-related
illnesses.
Heat waves
Extreme temperatures are among the most dangerous natural hazards. Over
the past five decades, human activities have released ample greenhouse gases
(GHGs), raising the mean global temperature and resulting in an increase in
the frequency and intensity of heat waves (Tollefson, 2018). Heat waves are

PRIORITISING CLIMATE CHANGE
AND HEALTH: THE CURRENT
STATUS OF HEAT-HEALTH IN INDIA

anticipated to worsen with climate change, leading to several heat-related
health consequences (Gasparrini et al., 2017; Nori-Sarma et al., 2019).
A heat wave is a prolonged period of abnormal high temperature which
causes temporary modifications in lifestyle and adverse health effects in the
population (Robinson, 2001). In India, heat waves usually occur during the
summer months of April to June. In some rare cases, they may start in
March and extend till the first or second week of July. The exact definition
of a heatwave varies by location, ambient temperature, humidity and physi-
cal, social and cultural adaptations (Robinson, 2001). The Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) declares a heat wave when there is an
excess of 5°C or 6°C above a normal maximum temperature less than or
equal to 40°C; or an excess of 4°C to 5°C above a normal maximum tem-
perature of more than 40°C (NDMA, 2019). However, if the actual maxi-
mum temperature is 45°C or more, a heat wave is declared irrespective of
the normal maximum temperature. The normal temperature for that day is
derived from a 30-year record of historical temperatures for that area’s
weather station (NDMA, 2019). The IMD definition does not take into
account any health impacts such as morbidity or mortality in determining
thresholds for declaring heat waves.
The impact of heat waves on human health
Several research studies have shown an increased number of deaths during
heat waves (D'Ippoliti et al., 2010). In 2003, a heat wave in Europe caused
excess mortality estimates varying from 25,000 to 70,000 deaths (Maughan,
2012). Very few studies have been conducted in India to assess the effect of
ambient temperature on human health. In India, from 1992 to 2015, heat
waves have caused 22,653 officially reported deaths; this number includes
over 2,500 deaths in India’s deadliest heat wave during the summer of 2015
(NDMA, 2019). Heat- related morbidity and mortality can occur due to
direct or indirect effects. Direct effects include heat-related illnesses from
heat exhaustion to heat stroke. The indirect effects on physiological systems
can cause renal insufficiency and exacerbate cardiovascular diseases, respi-
ratory problems and acute cerebrovascular disease.
According to the latest study by the Indian Meteorological Department
(IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the average
heat index of India has increased significantly per decade at the rate of
0.56°C and 0.32°C in summer and monsoon respectively, which is statisti-
cally significant at 95% level (Jaswal et al., 2017). The heat index is a single
number which is calculated based upon a combination of different environ-
mental parameters such as temperature and humidity to posit a human-
perceived equivalent temperature.
During heat waves, hospital admissions also increased due to people suf-
fering from heat exhaustion, heat syncope, severe dehydration and
P R I Y A D U T T A E T A L .108
vomiting. Depletion of salt and electrolytes in the body can cause heat
cramps while working under the direct sun could lead to heat exhaustion.
The total impact of heat wave events on mortality in India could be even
higher, as these figures probably refer to reported deaths from heatstroke
only. Morbidities due to heat waves are not even counted.
Populations at risk
An increase in ambient temperature contributes directly to an increase in
mortality, particularly among those who are vulnerable. Pregnant women,
elderly people and young children are more vulnerable to extreme heat.
Elderly age group: Ageing can be characterised by a complex process in
which progressive age-specific deteriorations of internal physiological
systems inevitably impair the body’s capacity to respond to extreme
heat. In the elderly population, there is also a deterioration in the abil-
ity to dissipate heat, a process pivotal to the maintenance of normal
core temperature, especially in extreme heat conditions. Further, heat-
related illnesses can also exacerbate existing medical conditions that
can make elderly more vulnerable to extreme heat.
Pregnant women: Pregnant and postpartum women and their infants
are uniquely vulnerable to the health impacts of heat waves, due
to the many physiological changes that occur as a result of preg-
nancy. Pregnancy increases likelihood for fatigue and dehydration.
Dehydration can lead to preterm uterine contractions and even labour.
Infants and children: Due to their anatomical, cognitive, immunological
and psychological differences, children and infants are more vulner-
able to extreme heat than adults. Because of their small surface-to-
body ratio, infants and children are more vulnerable to dehydration
and heat stress. During extreme heat events, children are more likely
to be affected by respiratory disease, renal disease, electrolyte imbal-
ance and fever.
The urban heat island effect
Heat waves have a much larger health impact in cities than in surrounding
suburban and rural areas. Indian cities are rapidly urbanising with skyrock-
eting development that converts open space into paved, heat-trapping roofs
and roads. These hot surfaces absorb and later re-radiate the sun’s thermal
energy, worsening city temperatures relative to surrounding rural areas,
thereby amplifying the urban heat island effect and increased air pollution
(Singh et al., 2020).
There are a number of evidences suggesting that heat-related risks might
be reduced through the systemic development of Heat Action Plans which
include early warning systems, community awareness strategies and
T H E S T A T U S O F H E A T H E A L T H I N I N D I A109
capacity building of various stakeholders (Hess et al., 2018; Benmarhnia et
al., 2019). Therefore, public health intervention is required to deal with the
impact of heat waves on human health in India. The heat action plan should
be an essential component of city planning for the management and preven-
tion of heat-related illnesses. In India, several efforts have been made to
implement public health strategies to combat the negative effect of heat
waves (Box 11.1).
Box 11.1 Case study
The development and implementation of South Asia’s first
heat action plan in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India
In May 2010, the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat witnessed a major
heat wave with a peak temperature of 47°C on 21 May, resulting in
over 300 deaths in one day and in excess of 800 deaths in one week
(Azhar et al., 2014) (Figure 11.1). Following this, the Indian Institute
of Public Health, Gandhinagar (IIPHG), supported by national and
international partners, developed and implemented a Heat Action
Plan (HAP) in Ahmedabad in 2013. Heat wave early warning systems
and adaptation plans have reduced heat wave related mortalities and
morbidities in various parts of the world (Knowlton et al., 2014). The
Heat Action Plan implemented in Ahmedabad was the first innova-
tive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat

events in South Asia, based on learnings from Europe and America
(Knowlton et al., 2014).
Heat action plans include early warning systems that alert citizens
and organizations in advance of extreme heat, and enable them to
respond effectively to save lives. The important strategies of the
Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan involved the following components:
firstly, building public awareness and community outreach; secondly,
an early warning system and inter-agency coordination; thirdly,
capacity building of healthcare professionals; and finally, reducing
heat exposure and promoting adaptive measures (Figure 11.2). One
of the most important components of a Heat Action Plan is the inter-
agency emergency response framework for effective coordination
between various departments of municipal administration
(Figure 11.3). The administration issues a heat alert based on thresh-
olds determined by the IMD, and uses a colour signal system as an
additional means of communication. Depending on the alert that has
been issued, different departments will activate their channel and per-
form pre-defined activities (Table 11.1).

The impact of the Ahmedabad heat action plan in
reducing mortality due to extreme heat events
A preliminary health outcome evaluation analysis suggests that there was at
least a 25% decrease from May’s excess all-cause mortality in the two years
since the HAP was launched (Hess et al., 2018). Hess et al. estimated that

the Ahmedabad Heat Action Plan (HAP) saves hundreds of lives every sum-
mer, and found a decrease in all-cause mortality in the first two years
(2014–2015) after the HAP was implemented. The results of this ecological
study indicate that the HAP was associated with reduced mortality during
the heat season in 2014–2015, especially at higher temperatures (Hess et
al., 2018). The Ahmedabad HAP was successful in reducing heat-related
illnesses, and the plan has been scaled up in other places across the nation
such as Odisha and the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. The National
Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has developed national guide-
lines for the prevention and management of heat waves based on the
Ahmedabad HAP (Box 11.2).
In subsequent years, cool roof technologies have been added as an addi-
tional important strategy under the Heat Action Plan. Cool roofs reflect
sunlight and absorb less heat, offering a simple and cost-effective solution
to the urban heat island challenge. A study conducted in Ahmedabad slums
found that cool roof technologies such as thermocol insulation and solar
reflective white paint on the outer surface of the roof can effectively reduce
the indoor temperature as compared to non-intervention roofing (Vellingiri
et al., 2020).
Limitations to the development and implementation of HAPs
An important limitation to the effective development and implementation
of a heat action plan is the unavailability of health-related data on heat-
related illnesses on a daily or weekly basis. Without health-related data, it is
impossible to work out a city-specific temperature threshold and heat stress
index. There are several challenges to conducting heat health research in
India. Due to the modest registration of deaths, it is very difficult to obtain
all- cause mortality data. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the effects
of heat on cause-specific mortality in sufficiently large sample sizes. Another
limitation is the lack of India-specific or region-specific Heat Stress Index
data. The present early warning system is largely based on epidemiological
studies which links temperature and mortality data, i.e. by correlating the
daily temperature- mortality relationship.
Due to the efforts of the National Disaster Management Authority, the
Indian Meteorological Department and IIPHG, many cities have developed
their heat action plans based on the Ahmedabad HAP. However, effective
implementation is lacking, as there is no state-level monitoring.
At the national level, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the
Environment and other line ministries should work jointly under the
National Mission on Climate Change and Human Health to implement
climate resilience heat action plans. The government should prioritise inte-
grating climate services for health in public health policy and planning.

illnesses.
Box 11.2 Case study
The development and implementation of India’s first climate
resilience heat action plan in rural settings under the
Rajasthan climate change project
More than two-thirds of the population of Rajasthan live in rural
areas. There has been an increasing trend of heat waves in Rajasthan
over the past several years in which several cities in Rajasthan have
been severely affected. The Thar Desert area consists of 12 districts
covering 60% of the area of Rajasthan and is largely affected by
extreme heat events. The IIPHG partnered with UNCIEF Rajasthan
and the Government of Rajasthan for the development and implemen-
tation of a climate resilience heat action plan in rural settings. The aim
of this project was to pilot a model for the prevention and manage-
ment of heat waves in the rural settings of Rajasthan, based on learn-
ings from Ahmedabad. The project districts in the pilot were Jalore,
Udaipur and Jaipur. The important activities of the project were:
• To understand the impact of climate change on health
• To develop a Climate Resilience Heat Action Plan for selected
blocks of Rajasthan
• To build capacity and generate awareness among healthcare
professionals
• To generate awareness of heat-related illness prevention and
management among students and teachers.
Various innovative approaches were used, such as organising a Heat
Awareness Day and a Mass Awareness Rally; harnessing the potential
of children in community awareness; capacity building of frontline
health workers and medical officers; and comprehensive Information,
Education and Communication (IEC) material made available in
local languages. All these activities helped to mainstream climate
change within the public health system. The state government then
scaled up activities in districts.

6. Time trends in the impact attributable to cold days in Spain: Incidence of local factors

Abstract
Background
While numerous studies have shown that the impact of cold waves is decreasing as result of various processes of adaptation, far fewer have analysed the time trend shown by such impact, and still fewer have done so for the different provinces of a single country, moreover using a specific cold waves definition for each. This study thus aimed to analyse the time trend of the impact of cold days on daily mortality in Spain across the period 1983–2003.
Methods
For study purposes, we used daily mortality data for all natural causes except accidents in ten Spanish provinces. The time series was divided into three subperiods. For each period and province, the value of Tthreshold was obtained via the percentile corresponding to the cold day's definition for that province obtained in previous studies. Relative Risks (RRs) and Population Attributable Fraction (PARs) were calculated using Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) with the Poisson regression link. Seasonalities, trends and autoregressive components were controlled. Global RRs and ARs were calculated with the aid of a meta-analysis with random effects for each of the periods.
Results
The results show that the RRs for Spain as a whole were 1.12 (95% CI: 1.08 1.16) for the first period, 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09 1.22) for the second and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.10 1.26) for the third. The impact of cold days has risen slightly over time, though the differences were not statistically significant. These findings show a clearly different behaviour pattern to that previously found for heat.
Conclusion
The results obtained in this study do not show a downward trend for colds days. The complexity of the biological mechanisms involved in cold-related mortality and the lack of robust results mean that more research must be done in this particular field of public health.

7. Chapter 1
Introduction: Climate Risks
in the Health Sector
Abstract This chapter details the structure of the book, and introduces relevant
terminology and concepts used in it. The first section describes the scope of the
book while the second section presents the conceptual framing in terms of risks to
the health sector and adaptation for managing the risks from climate change. It
presents the current evidence on climate change and projected risks for the health
sector, the association between different climate drivers and prevalence of selected
diseases, and concerns of exposure and vulnerability across regions of the world.

Here is a succinct high-level summary of Chapter 1: **Introduction: Climate Risks in the Health Sector**, focusing on the context of developing economies, specifically India.

**Core Thesis**
The chapter argues that for developing economies like India, climate change poses risks that have "far reaching consequences for human health," primarily acting as a "multiplier" of current vulnerabilities. The text asserts that "until mid Century, climate change is expected to act mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist."

**Key Risks and Regional Evidence**
The text relies on IPCC AR5 data to categorize risks by region:
*   **Asia:** The primary risks are "mortality from heat and floods, injuries and infectious diseases due to floods, increases in water and vector-borne diseases, and malnutrition."
*   **Vector-Borne Diseases:** There is "high confidence" regarding the link between climate and disease.
    *   **Dengue:** Currently affects up to 100 countries with "50 million cases being reported per year."
    *   **Malaria:** By 2030, "an estimated 3.6 billion people are at risk of malaria, of which a 100 million is attributable to climate change." In Africa, cases may increase by "5–7 % among at risk populations at higher altitudes."
*   **Mortality Projections:** Citing WHO estimates, the text notes that "an additional 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050, could occur due to some well understood impacts of climate change."
    *   Breakdown by 2030: "48,000 additional deaths due to diarrhoeal illness among children... 60,000 deaths due to Malaria, another 38,000 deaths due to heat exposure among the elderly."

**Challenges in Policy and Adaptation**
The chapter highlights a significant "adaptation deficit" in developing nations:
*   **Current Status:** "Integrating climate risks within mainstream health planning and policy is virtually absent in most developing countries."
*   **The Indian Context:** "In India so far, there has been scant attention to these concerns," particularly regarding the "detection and attribution of health effects from climate change."
*   **Strategic Requirement:** Effective adaptation requires a dual approach: "responding to an amplification of existing threats to public health" while simultaneously developing "new management strategies in response to distinctly new threats."

**Conclusion**
Building resilience requires "accelerating public health and medical interventions to reduce the present burden of disease" as the "single most important step." The text warns that without economic decision-making supporting these strategies, "risks for heat mortality reach very high levels even under 2 °C warming in the long term."
